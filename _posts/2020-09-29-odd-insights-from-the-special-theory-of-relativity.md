I have been studying the theoretical aspects of the Special Theory of
Relativity. Although I lack a firm mathematical understanding of all the
principles, I have a few questions lingering on my mind. It is challenging to
fathom the ideas that lead to this whole facade. This write-up is about some
mind-boggling afterthoughts.

## Maxwell’s Equations

[Maxwell’s Equations][maxwells-equations] give out the value for the constant
speed at which electromagnetic waves propagate in the vacuum.[^1] This
mathematical constant is popularly known as the speed of light, $$c$$. Long
after its discovery, scientists measured the speed of light which came out to be
the same as predicted by Maxwell’s Equations.

## Entanglement with the Special Theory of Relativity

Maxwell’s Equations predicted the speed of light but didn’t define its inertial
frame of reference. When we talk about speed, it’s always relative to something,
but Maxwell’s Equations mentioned no such thing. The only viable explanation
that scientists could come up with at the time was that an invisible,
unobservable substance, called [Aether][aether], constitutes the vacuum of
space. It is the medium through which gravitational forces and electromagnetic
waves propagate.

Later in 1905, Einstein contradicted the presence of Aether in his [Special
Theory of Relativity][special-relativity]. It stated that light or any other
electromagnetic waves don’t propagate through Aether, or rather, the speed of
light is a universal constant.[^2] All observers will measure it precisely the
same in their reference frames, irrespective of the motion of its source.

Let us consider yourself as a stationary observer and that I am travelling
towards you with a flashlight at $$10\%$$ the speed of light. Now if you were to
measure the speed of light emitted from the flashlight, you will still find it
to be $$c$$ rather than $$1.1 \times c$$.[^3]

To put it other words, if the speed of light remains constant for both
observers, it must imply that at least one or both quantities constituting the
speed &mdash; i.e., distance (or length) and time &mdash; must vary in different
inertial frames. In the previous example, when the source was moving towards the
observer, we concluded that the speed of light remains the same. It must mean
that the stationary observer was observing the time for the moving source to be
passing by faster.

## Food for thoughts

### Does light itself experience time?

The following equations represent how time dilates for a source in motion. Here,
$$v$$ is the speed of the source as observed by a stationary observer,
$$\gamma$$ is the Lorentz Factor, $$t$$ is the time as measured by the source,
and $$t'$$ is the dilated time as observed by the observer. Lorentz Factor
arises in the derivation of the [Lorentz transformation][lorentz-transformation]
used to transform measurements across inertial reference frames in Special
Relativity.[^4]

$$\beta = \frac{v}{c}$$

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}$$

$$t' = \gamma \times t$$

Now let us consider a quantum of light, a photon moving towards an observer.
From the photon's frame of reference, it is stationary while the observer is
moving towards it at the speed of light. The Lorentz Factor, $$\gamma$$ here
tends towards infinity. Does it mean that the photon doesn’t experience time? A
simple answer can be a no, but this question is the hardest to answer because
answering it implies discovering the theory of everything. A hypothesis that
unites the physics that deals with subatomic particles, with the physics that
deals with large objects.

### So does it mean that time travel is possible?

To the future? Yes! To the past? It's hard to tell! To time travel to the
future, all you have to do is travel very fast for some time and then return
home. If you also read the [General Theory of Relativity][general-relativity]
before leaving, you may find it worthwhile to orbit around an object
considerably more massive than Earth.
