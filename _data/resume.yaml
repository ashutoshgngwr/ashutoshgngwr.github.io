        subtitle: Founder

        timeline: 2019 - Present
        body: |
          I built an app to create ambient sound environments, starting as a
          side project and turning into a solopreneurship venture. I architected
          a robust backend, including a [REST
          API](https://github.com/trynoice/api), using PostgreSQL, Spring Boot
          and Nginx with extensive automated testing, running entirely on AWS
          EC2, serving 1.7 million monthly requests on average and witnessing
          just one operational incident in the past six months. I wrote the
          [Android app](https://github.com/trynoice/android-app) in Kotlin using
          modern architecture components with automated testing. I made a
          [browser app](https://github.com/trynoice/web-app-v0), a [Chromecast
          Receiver app](https://github.com/trynoice/chromecast-receiver-app) and
          a [website](https://github.com/trynoice/website) using React, Gatsby
          and Parcel. To achieve gapless playback in browsers, I created a
          custom audio encoding format using MP3 and a [TypeScript
          module](https://github.com/trynoice/january) to play it. I deployed
          release automation across all components to shorten the development
          cycle. As a result of these efforts, Noice currently has over 9k
          monthly active users. The Android app has a Play Store rating of 4.4/5
          and over 730 GitHub stars. _[Stats as of June 2023]_

        body: |
          I contributed significantly to an early-stage PaaS product within a
          self-directed team under the founder's supervision. I built a metrics
          aggregation and caching layer to ensure efficient resource allocation
          for end-user container workloads. I also established a cluster
          monitoring and observability stack for internal modules and user
          workloads and spearheaded automation efforts to deploy and scale Ceph
          storage clusters. I also took the initiative to set up and maintain
          the development infrastructure to improve the developer experience.

        body: |
          I focused on [eSim](https://esim.fossee.in/home), an electronic
          circuit simulation toolkit. I addressed several bugs, resolved open
          tickets in its main dependency, [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/), and
          built automation to streamline deployment across different operating
          systems.
